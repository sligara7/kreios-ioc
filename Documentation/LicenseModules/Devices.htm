        <h2>Devices</h2>
        <p>Many SPECS devices and other third party instruments can be controlled by SpecsLab Prodigy. There are two ways to access devices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As standalone devices. You can access many, or all, features that are available on the front panel of the power supply.</li>
          <li>As part of an experiment. The device can be added to the schedule and activated with the desired parameter values at certain points in the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
