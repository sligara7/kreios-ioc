        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>This module provides control for the IQE 12/38 and IQE 11/35 sputter gun, allowing you to set up sputter cycles for sample preparation. If available, the VCU 1000 valve control unit can also be accessed, enabling you to set the gas pressure for the sputtering.</p>
        <p>The module does not allow for annealing. However, other functionality in SpecsLab Prodigy enables you to set the temperature using the EBH 150 sample heater. By using the Sleep function, you can heat the sample for a specified time.</p>
        <p>It is easy to build up a schedule of sputter/ anneal cycles that will fully automate your sample preparation.</p>
