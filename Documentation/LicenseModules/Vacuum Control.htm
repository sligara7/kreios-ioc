        <h2>Vacuum Control</h2>
        <p>The vacuum control module shows the valves, pumps and pressure gauges in a SPECS vacuum system. You can read the status of each device and control certain items, for example, switching off pumps.</p>
        <p>There is a graphical view which shows a schematic of the vacuum system. A table view lists the vacuum devices, with the option of a large display for some parameters - ideal for gas dosing.</p>
        <p>While each device can be read and controlled within SpecsLab Prodigy, the vacuum control module can also run standalone as an independent application.</p>
