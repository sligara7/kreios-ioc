        <h2>Remote Out</h2>
        <p>The Remote Out device feature allows you to run scripts or control devices that are not directly supported by SPECS. It uses a text-based protocol to send device commands over TCP, UDP or a serial connection. Any instrument which can be controlled in this way can be adapted for use in SpecsLab Prodigy.</p>
        <p>Please refer to the document "Configuration and Use of Remote Out Devices" for more details about configuring and using remote out devices.</p>
