        <h2>Profiling</h2>
        <p>Dimension profiling allows you to change device parameters, running a spectrum group after each change.</p>
        <p>A simple example of this is to move a manipulator a fixed distance between scans in order to build up a spatial chemical map of the surface. However, any item of equipment with adjustable operating parameters is suitable. You could set change the HV settings in the X-ray source in order to measure as a function of X-ray power.</p>
        <p>You can add any number of dimensions to the experiment, running scans for each combination. The only practical limit is the time taken to record the data.</p>
