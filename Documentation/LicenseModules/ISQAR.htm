        <h2>ISQAR</h2>
        <p>Identification of Samples by Quantitative Analysis and Reporting</p>
        <p> The ISQAR module provides an easy way to compute the elemental concentrations from XPS spectrums and export the results in a Microsoft Word&trade; or Adobe PDF&trade; file. The automatic peak identification gives an easy start by highlighting possible elements in the sample. With a few mouse clicks an initial quantification result can be obtained which can be further refined by selecting different methods for Inelastic Mean Free Path (IMFP) calculation, adapting parameters of background functions or separating overlapping peaks (multi-peak analysis).</p>

        <p>Advanced users can retrace all computation steps back to the integrated databases and thus get a full understanding of the results. Those databases can be easily extended with user databases to properly reflect material specific properties which deviate from the standard references given in literature. The quantification can also be performed under different angles of the sample. The geometry of the system, manipulator, and sample are automatically taken into account, if remote controlled. The result of the quantification can be exported for reporting purposes.</p>
