        <h2>Auto Flood Gun Adjustment</h2>
        <p>XPS experiments on insulating surfaces are difficult because the surface charges up as a result of photoemission. This prevents reliable measurements of the surface, or even any measurement at all.</p>
        <p>In order to compensate for charging, a low energy electron source can irradiate the surface. However, this damages the sample in many cases. The trade-off is peak quality against flood gun emission current.</p>
        <p>The auto flood gun adjustment module automatically measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a peak as a function of flood gun emission current. Following a series of scans, it evaluates the data and finds the emission current with the smallest peak FWHM. SpecsLab Prodigy then sets the flood gun to this emission current and continues to run the experiment.</p>
