        <h2>Basic</h2>
        <p>The basic configuration of SpecsLab Prodigy allows you to acquire and analyze data. For this, you need to configure the following equipment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>EC 10 ethernet–CAN converter for communication with the equipment.</li>
          <li>PHOIBOS analyzer. Select the 1D or ND according to your detector.</li>
          <li>Excitation source, such as a UV (dummy) or an X-ray source. If you do not  have a SPECS X-ray source, you can configure the XR 50 or XR 50M as a dummy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information about licensing modules and devices, please refer to the SpecsLab Prodigy Quick Guide.</p>
