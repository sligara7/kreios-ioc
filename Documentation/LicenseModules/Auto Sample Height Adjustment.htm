        <h2>Auto Sample Height Adjustment</h2>
        <p>The lens system on the front of a SPECS electron energy analyzer has a focus which determines the working point. For optimum performance, the sample should be exactly at this point. This is particularly important for small excitation spots, such as from an electron gun or a synchrotron.</p>
        <p>The auto sample height adjustment feature changes the sample position until the optimum distance between the sample and analyzer is located. It does this by moving the sample in the Z direction in front of the analyzer and measuring the signal intensity. It then moves the sample to the optimum position and starts the measurement.</p>
